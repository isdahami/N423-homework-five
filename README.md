# N423: Homework Five

Create a web application that interfaces with Firebase Firestore. Set up a Firebase project with Firestore as the database. In the Firestore database, there's a collection named "Albums" and 15 documents representing albums. Each album document includes album name, artist name, album photo URL, and up to three genres. When the website loads, it fetches and display all albums and their details. Additionally, there is a genre filtering feature, allowing users to select and view albums by genre.
